# BYTECURRY.BUFFERS

This project contains some useful tools for working with buffers including:

- A `buffer` class that implements a circular buffer.
- A piped-stream class that implements a piped stream for passing binary data
between threads.
- A copy-stream method for copying data from an input stream to an output stream.
